# Create an Azure Cosmos DB account and setup the database and collections using ARM and Powershell scripts

This repo contains a (bare minumum) ARM script to create an Azure CosmosDB database and a PowerShell script initialize the database and collections inside.

The way these files are set up are ideal for deployment in VSTS/TFS.

See my [blog post]() about this deployment.
